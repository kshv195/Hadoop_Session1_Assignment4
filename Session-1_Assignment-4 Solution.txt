Problem Statement
Task:4

Change the permission of the file /user/cloudera/hadoop/max-temp.txt, such that
only the owner and the group members have full control over the file.
Others do not have any control over it.

Solution:

Task4:Screenshot: Assignment4_Screenshot_Task4

Using the command chown changed the owner name to "keshav":
hdfs dfs -chown keshav /user/cloudera/hadoop/max-temp.txt

Using the command chgrp changed the group of ame to "group1":
hdfs dfs -chgrp group1 /user/cloudera/hadoop/max-temp.txt

BUT as i am using cloudera distribution, it is not allowing me to change the name of the group and owner.
